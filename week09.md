# Week 9 (calendar week 13)

## General notes

Chapter 7 in Hailperin's book assumes that one has read the previous six chapters, which we of course haven't. We will return to threads and concurrency later, but it seems like the chapter on virtual memory will not be assigned reading. This is a shame, since it makes very good reading! See also the recommendations for further reading [below](#further-reading).

Instead, Peyman covers virtual memory in the lectures. If you wish to follow the lectures instead of reading the book, I recommend watching (at least) the parts of the lecture covering slides 9-12, as well as slide 14 up until 'Issues'. In my own experience, the rest of the material is perhaps best digested by reading Hailperin's book (or the literature mentioned [below](#further-reading)) slowly.

## Further reading

Hailperin's book is very good, but the order in which we cover the material makes it slightly unoptimal reading. For a very readable introduction to processes and virtual memory, I very much like

1. Arpaci-Dusseau, *Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces* (also known as 'OSTEP'). The three 'pieces' are virtualisation (including processes and virtual memory), concurrency (here we meet threads) and persistence (where the authors discuss I/O, file systems, those kinds of things). The book is freely available [as a PDF](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/).

Relevant for us this week are chs. 4-6 (and 3 for fun) on processes, and chs. 13-15 (and 12 for fun) on virtual memory. Chs. 16-24 cover much more about virtual memory which is also highly recommended reading, but my feeling is that there is rather more material here than is necessary for the course.
