# Week 8 (calendar week 12)

## General notes

In this week's exercises we have to supply powers of two as command line arguments to an executable. Instead of computing the value of such a power and pasting this into the terminal, we can instead perform arithmetic directly in the terminal.


### Arithmetic in Bash on Linux (and Mac)

The default shell on most Linux distributions (including Ubuntu, as well as the distribution running on our Raspberry Pi) is Bash (see [`bash`(1)](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bash.1.html)). If `<expression>` is some arithmetic expression, then

    $((<expression>))

evaluates the expression. You can use this to compute powers of two and pass the resulting value as an argument to a command. For instance, the command

    ./myprogram $((2**8))

will pass the power $2^8$ to the program `myprogram`. Note that we use `**` and not `^` to denote exponentiation.


### Arithmetic on Mac

The default shell on macOS is Zsh which is similar to Bash, but I haven't used it myself. The above may also work here.


### Arithmetic in PowerShell on Windows

In PowerShell we don't need to use the `$`-syntax, but as far as I know PowerShell does not have an exponentiation operator. Instead we can use left shifts:

    ./myprogram.exe (1 -shl 8)


## Hand-in

### Task 1

Note that there was a mistake in the first version of `Bst.java`, so make sure you have the latest version.


### Task 2

Just as you don't have to know binary search before doing this task, you also don't need to explain binary search in your solution!

The method `compBST` should be easy enough to understand, especially if you already know about binary search.


### Task 3

The method `slcompBST` (`sl` for 'slanted') is similar to `compBST`, but notice the role played by the `slFactor` parameter.

To understand `predBST`, first recall that `int` is a 32-bit signed integer type. Since the operator `>>` denotes an *arithmetic* right shift (see [my notes for week 4](week04.md) for the distinction between arithmetic and logical right shifts), what does the value of `(x-A[mid])>>31` tell us about `x-A[mid]`? And what does that tell us about how `x` and `A[mid]` relate to each other? Finally recall that `&` is bitwise AND.

When comparing expected runtimes, it may be useful to think back to the exercises in week 4. Of course don't immediately disregard your na√Øve expectations either, in particular in the computations of `left` and `right` in each of the methods.

Also see the comment below the description of Task 4.


### Task 4

When running the programs from the terminal, the syntax for evaluating arithmetic expressions mentioned [above](#general-notes) may be helpful.
